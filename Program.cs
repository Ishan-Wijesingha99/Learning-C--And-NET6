// C# is an object-oriented programming language

// first, in the terminal you need to create a C# app, there are so many different types of apps for C#, you can create a web app, a software app that can be run by windows, linux or Mac etc etc. Simplest C# app to create is a console, to do this use the command: dotnet new console
// then to run the code, use the command: dotnet run (this will automatically run Program.cs)



using System;

// here we create a class called HelloWorld
public class HelloWorld {
  
  // here we create a method inside the class 
  public static void Main(string[] args) {
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
  }
}
